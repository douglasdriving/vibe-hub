When you press \"fix\" or any other prompt, that one is just copied and fired right into that terminal. Instead of flipping between vibe-hub and the claude terminal, you would simply move between the different project pages to see how claude is doing there. Important note is that claude have to keep running even if you exit out of a project page and back to the dashboard.",
