  "feedbackRefinement": "I need help refining raw feedback for {PROJECT_NAME}.\n\n**Read the raw feedback** - Please read the feedback file at:\n{PROJECT_PATH}/.vibe/feedback.json\n\nThis file contains raw feedback items that need to be refined into actionable issues.\n\n**Your Task - Refine Feedback:**\n\nFor each pending feedback item:\n\n1. **Ask Clarifying Questions**: If anything is unclear or ambiguous, ask me questions to fully understand:\n   - What exactly is the problem or desired feature?\n   - What are the constraints or requirements?\n   - Are there any edge cases to consider?\n\n2. **Critique and Suggest Alternatives**: Critically evaluate the feedback:\n   - Is this the best approach to solve the problem?\n   - Are there simpler or better alternatives?\n   - What are the trade-offs of this approach?\n   - Should this be done at all, or is there a better solution?\n\n3. **Break Into Subtasks**: If I agree with your analysis, break the feedback into:\n   - Clear, actionable subtasks (numbered list)\n   - Each subtask should be specific and testable\n   - Order subtasks by logical implementation sequence\n\n4. **Estimate Time**: Provide a realistic time estimate for the entire issue (e.g., \"2 hours\", \"1 day\", \"3 days\")\n\n5. **Create Refined Issues**: For each feedback item, create refined issue(s) with:\n   - Title: Short summary (5-10 words)\n   - Description: Detailed explanation of what needs to be done and why\n   - Subtasks: Numbered list of specific tasks\n   - Time Estimate: Your estimate from step 4\n   - Priority: Keep the same priority as the original feedback\n\n6. **Update Data Files**:\n   - Add refined issues to {PROJECT_PATH}/.vibe/issues.json\n   - Move the raw feedback from feedback.json to feedback-archive.json\n   - Link them: set refinedIntoIssueIds on archived feedback, set originalFeedbackId on issues\n\n**Important**: Focus on refinement quality, not implementation. Implementation will happen in a separate workflow after all feedback is refined.",
  "issueFix": "I need help implementing refined issues for {PROJECT_NAME}.\n\n**Read the issues** - Please read the issues file at:\n{PROJECT_PATH}/.vibe/issues.json\n\nThese are refined, actionable issues ready for implementation. Each issue has already been analyzed, broken into subtasks, and estimated.\n\n**Your Task - Implement Issues:**\n\n1. **Create an Implementation Plan**: Review all issues and create a structured plan that:\n   - Identifies which issues are related or dependent on each other\n   - Groups related issues that should be fixed together in the same commit\n   - Orders fixes by dependency (fix issues that others depend on first)\n   - Numbers each fix in the plan\n\n2. **Implement ALL Fixes**: After presenting the plan, work through ALL fixes without stopping:\n   - For each complete issue:\n     * Implement all changes following the subtasks\n     * Run all tests you can yourself (build, type-check, etc.)\n     * Commit once per complete issue (not per subtask or file) with a short message describing the change\n   - Continue through the entire list without waiting for my testing\n   - Do NOT push any commits yet\n\n3. **Testing Phase**: After ALL fixes are implemented and committed:\n   - Provide me with a comprehensive test checklist covering all changes\n   - I will test each commit one by one\n   - If I find issues, we'll fix them iteratively\n   - Once all tests pass, we'll push all commits together\n\n4. **Do NOT push code** until I have tested all changes and confirmed everything works.\n\nThis workflow allows you to work through all issues efficiently while ensuring everything is tested before being pushed to the repository.",
  "ideaRefinement": "I have an initial idea for a project called: {PROJECT_NAME}\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n1. **Read the project idea** - First, please read the idea.md file in the .vibe folder at:\n   {PROJECT_PATH}/.vibe/idea.md\n\n2. **Research existing alternatives** - Before we proceed, please web search for:\n   - Existing apps/projects that solve the same or similar problems\n   - Open source projects that might already do what I'm trying to build\n   - Commercial products in this space\n\n   For each alternative you find, briefly describe:\n   - What it does and how it compares to my idea\n   - Whether it's open source (and if so, if it could be forked/extended)\n   - Key differences from my proposed approach\n\n3. **Question the approach** - Based on the problem described in idea.md:\n   - Is there a simpler or more straightforward way to solve this problem?\n   - Are there alternative approaches I should consider?\n   - What are the trade-offs of my proposed approach vs alternatives?\n\n4. **Iterate on the idea** - Based on your research and analysis:\n   - Ask clarifying questions about unclear aspects\n   - Suggest improvements to the core concept\n   - Help me refine the idea to ensure it's worth building\n   - Point out any potential issues or challenges\n\n5. **Finalize the idea** - Once we've discussed alternatives and refined the concept:\n   - Update the idea.md file with our refined thinking\n   - Make sure it clearly articulates the problem, solution, and why this approach makes sense\n\n**Important**: The goal here is to make sure we're building something worthwhile.
