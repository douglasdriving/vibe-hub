- currently, almost no information is displayed about any of the projects. in the dashboard view, 3 are listed with their title being the name of their folder, and under all 3 it just says "unknown". no project name, no description, no feedback item count, no deployment status, no last modified date. There is also no way to add this information in. Please check how this information is supposed to be retrieved for each project, if it does so correctly. and if there IS no information for a given project, please make sure to include a way to "initialize" that project, so that basic information about it can be entered and saved properly.
- this is also true for the project page itself. it shows almost no information, just "last modified: unknown", and under project information "path: ...". this should all also be possible to initialize/fill out so that it is stored correctly inside of some metadata file in the given project folder. make sure this is possible!
- "Can be edited inline or loaded from project's README/docs" - there is no way to edit the info inline now.
- "Visual indication if loaded from file vs. manually entered" it would be preferred if this eventually was synced, so that if you enter it manually, it also gets stored on the metadata file inside of that projects folder. it should be the same information always synced between vibe hub and the project folder.
- "Priority badge (1-5 with color coding and label)" - there is no color coding at the moment! please fix.
-  there is also no date added on the feedback item, but this is actually not THAT important, so you can omitt it for now (remove from design spec mvp doc, and tech spec)
- in the design spec, it was said that the claude code button should have a dropdown to open with feedback context or selected feedback. this is NOT the case! you can only press the button to open claude without context. please add these options in.
- when trying to press the little select icon on a feedback card, nothing happens, and I get this error: "Failed to toggle feedback: invalid args `updates` for command `update_feedback`: missing field `id`"
