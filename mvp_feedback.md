- "Priority badge (1-5 with color coding and label)" - there is no color coding at the moment! please fix.
- instead of editing the information of an existing project manually, create a prompt to let claude code to it. The app should make the empty metadata-file and add it to the project folder, and then if it sees that it has not been edited yet, it shows a button to open claude with a specific prompt that makes claude fill out that metadata file with the right information.
